		<p>The [facility, except for Transplant Center] must comply with all applicable Federal, State and local emergency preparedness requirements. The [facility] must establish and maintain a comprehensive emergency preparedness program that meets the requirements of this section.* The emergency preparedness program must include, but not be limited to, the following elements: *[For hospitals at &sect;482.15:] The hospital must comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local emergency preparedness requirements. The hospital must develop and maintain a comprehensive emergency preparedness program that meets the requirements of this section, utilizing an all-hazards approach. *[For CAHs at &sect;485.625:] The CAH must comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local emergency preparedness requirements. The CAH must develop and maintain a comprehensive emergency preparedness program, utilizing an all-hazards approach.</p>
		<label>Interpretive Guidelines</label>
		<p>Under this condition/requirement, facilities are required to develop an emergency preparedness program that meets all of the standards specified within the condition/requirement. The emergency preparedness program must describe a facility's comprehensive approach to meeting the health, safety, and security needs of their staff and patient population during an emergency or disaster situation. The program must also address how the facility would coordinate with other healthcare facilities, as well as the whole community during an emergency or disaster (natural, man-made, facility). The emergency preparedness program must be reviewed annually. A comprehensive approach to meeting the health and safety needs of a patient population should encompass the elements for emergency preparedness planning based on the "all-hazards" definition and specific to the location of the facility. For instance, a facility in a large flood zone, or tornado prone region, should have included these elements in their overall planning in order to meet the health, safety, and security needs of the staff and of the patient population. Additionally, if the patient population has limited mobility, facilities should have an approach to address these challenges during emergency events. The term "comprehensive" in this requirement is to ensure that facilities do not only choose one potential emergency that may occur in their area, but rather consider a multitude of events and be able to demonstrate that they have considered this during their development of the emergency preparedness plan. Survey Procedures o Interview the facility leadership and ask him/her/them to describe the facility's emergency preparedness program. o Ask to see the facility's written policy and documentation on the emergency preparedness program. o For hospitals and CAHs only: Verify the hospital's or CAH's program was developed based on an all-hazards approach by asking their leadership to describe how the facility used an all-hazards approach when developing its program.</p>

		<label>Interpretive Guidelines</label>
		<p>The Organization's emergency plan must address the location and use of alarm systems and signals. The plan must also include the methods used for containing fires, such as fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems and other current methods used. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) at section A.20.1.1.1.8, recognizes that certain functions necessary for the life safety of building occupants, such as the closing of corridor doors, the operation of manual fire alarm devices, and the removal of patients from the room of fire origin, require the intervention of facility staff. Therefore, the plan should follow guidelines set forth by the NFPA. Survey Procedures o Ask facility leadership to show the section of the plan which addresses location(s) and use of fire alarms. o Ask facility staff to describe the facility's current procedure for containing fires.</p>

However, a transplant center is not individually responsible for the emergency preparedness requirements set forth in &sect;482.15. (a) Standard: Policies and procedures. A transplant center must have policies and procedures that address emergency preparedness. These policies and procedures must be included in the hospital's emergency preparedness program. (b) Standard: Protocols with hospital and OPO. A transplant center must develop and maintain mutually agreed upon protocols that address the duties and responsibilities of the transplant center, the hospital in which the transplant center is operated, and the OPO designated by the Secretary, unless the hospital has an approved waiver to work with another OPO, during an emergency.</p>
		<label>Interpretive Guidelines</label>
		<p>Hospitals which have transplant centers must include within their emergency planning and preparedness process one representative, at minimum, from the transplant center. If a hospital has multiple transplant centers, each center must have at least one representative who is involved in the development and maintenance of the hospital's emergency preparedness process. The hospital must include the transplant center in its emergency preparedness plan policies and procedures, communication plans, as well is the training and testing programs. Both the hospital and the transplant center are required to demonstrate during a survey that they have coordinated in planning and the development of the emergency program. Both are required to have written documentation of the emergency preparedness plans. However, the transplant center is not individually responsible for the emergency preparedness requirements under &sect;482.15. Survey Procedures o Verify the hospital has written documentation to demonstrate that a representative of each transplant center participated in the development of the emergency program. o Ask to see documentation of emergency protocols that address transplant protocols that include the hospital, the transplant center and the associated OPOs.</p>

		<label>Interpretive Guidelines</label>
		<p>Facilities must develop and implement policies and procedures per the requirements of this standard. The policies and procedures are expected to align with the identified hazards within the facility's risk assessment and the facility's overall emergency preparedness program. We are not specifying where the facility must have the emergency preparedness policies and procedures. A facility may choose whether to incorporate the emergency policies and procedures within their emergency plan or to be part of the facility's Standard Operating Procedures or Operating Manual. However, the facility must be able to demonstrate compliance upon survey, therefore we recommend that facilities have a central place to house the emergency preparedness program documents (to include all policies and procedures) to facilitate review. Survey Procedures Review the written policies and procedures which address the facility's emergency plan and verify the following: o Policies and procedures were developed based on the facility- and community-based risk assessment and communication plan, utilizing an all-hazards approach. o Ask to see documentation that verifies the policies and procedures have been reviewed and updated on an annual basis.</p>

A transplant center must develop and maintain mutually agreed upon protocols that address the duties and responsibilities of the transplant center, the hospital in which the transplant center is operated, and the OPO designated by the Secretary, unless the hospital has an approved waiver to work with another OPO, during an emergency.</p>
		<label>Interpretive Guidelines</label>
		<p>Transplant centers must be involved in the development of mutually agreed upon protocols that address the duties and responsibilities of the hospital, transplant program and the designated OPO during emergencies. All transplant centers are located within Medicare participating hospitals. Any hospital that furnishes organ transplants and other medical and surgical specialty services for the care of transplant patients is defined as a transplant hospital (42 CFR 482.70). Therefore, transplant centers must meet all hospital CoPs at &sect;482.1 through 482.57 (as set forth at &sect;482.68(b)), and the hospitals in which they are located must meet the provisions of &sect;482.15, however, a transplant center is not individually responsible for the emergency preparedness requirements in &sect;482.15. The hospital in which a transplant center is located (i.e., a transplant hospital) would be responsible for ensuring that the transplant center is involved in the development of an emergency preparedness program. This requirement does not oblige a transplant center that agrees to care for another transplant center's patients during an emergency to put those patients on its waiting lists. We anticipate that most emergencies would be of short duration and that the transplant center that is affected by an emergency will resume its normal operations within a short period of time. However, if a transplant center does arrange for its patients to be transferred to another transplant center during an emergency, both transplant centers would need to determine what care would be provided to the transferring patients, including whether and under what circumstances the patients from the transferring transplant center would be added to the receiving center's waiting lists. Survey Procedures o Verify the transplant center has developed mutually agreed upon protocols that address the duties and responsibilities of the transplant center, the hospital in which the transplant center is operated, and the designated OPO. o Ask to see documentation of the protocols.</p>

(6) The following are additional requirements for hospice-operated inpatient care facilities only. The policies and procedures must address the following: (iii) The provision of subsistence needs for hospice employees and patients, whether they evacuate or shelter in place, include, but are not limited to the following: (A) Food, water, medical, and pharmaceutical supplies. (B) Alternate sources of energy to maintain the following: (1) Temperatures to protect patient health and safety and for the safe and sanitary storage of provisions. (2) Emergency lighting. (3) Fire detection, extinguishing, and alarm systems. (C) Sewage and waste disposal.</p>
		<label>Interpretive Guidelines</label>
		<p>Facilities must be able to provide for adequate subsistence for all patients and staff for the duration of an emergency or until all its patients have been evacuated and its operations cease. Facilities have flexibility in identifying their individual subsistence needs that would be required during an emergency. There are no set requirements or standards for the amount of provisions to be provided in facilities. Provisions include, but are not limited to, food, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. Provisions should be stored in an area which is less likely to be affected by disaster, such as storing these resources above ground-level to protect from possible flooding. Additionally, when inpatient facilities determine their supply needs, they are expected to consider the possibility that volunteers, visitors, and individuals from the community may arrive at the facility to offer assistance or seek shelter. It is up to each individual facility, based on its risk assessment, to determine the most appropriate alternate energy sources to maintain temperatures to protect patient health and safety and for the safe and sanitary storage of provisions, emergency lighting, fire detection, extinguishing, and alarm systems, and sewage and waste disposal. Facilities are not required to upgrade their alternate energy source or electrical systems, but after review of their risk assessment may find it prudent to make modifications. Regardless of the alternate sources of energy a facility chooses to utilize, it must be in accordance with local and state laws, manufacturer requirements, as well as applicable LSC requirements (for example, hospitals are required to have an essential electric system with a generator that complies with NFPA 99 - Health Care Facilities Code and associate reference documents). Facilities must establish policies and procedures that determine how required heating and cooling of their facility will be maintained during an emergency situation, as necessary, if there were a loss of the primary power source. Facilities are not required to heat and cool the entire building evenly, but must ensure safe temperatures are maintained in those areas deemed necessary to protect patients, other people who are in the facility, and provisions during the course of an emergency, as determined by the facility risk assessment. If unable to meet the temperature needs, a facility must have a relocation/evacuation plan (that may include internal relocation, relocation to other buildings on the campus or full evacuation. The relocation/evacuation must take place in a timely manner so as not to expose patients and residents to unsafe temperatures. If a facility risk assessment determines the best way to maintain temperatures, emergency lighting, fire detection and extinguishing systems and sewage and waste disposal would be through the use of a portable and mobile generator, rather than a permanent generator, then the LSC provisions such as generator testing, maintenance, etc. outlined under the NFPA guidelines requirements would not be applicable, except for NFPA 70 - National Electrical Code. Portable and mobile generators must: o Be connected to the facility electrical system through a compatible connecting device and transfer switch. o Be located where protected from damage during the course of an emergency. o Not be operated inside the facility, in an enclosed area such (e.g., garage, basement), or other location that would not allow for proper ventilation of the exhaust. o Not be located where exhaust from the engine would be brought into the facility through windows or other ventilation system intakes. o Not be located in proximity to the building where a generator fire could spread to the facility. o Be operated, tested and maintained in accordance with manufacturer, local and/or State requirements. For requirements regarding permanently installed generators, please refer to existing Life Safety Code and NFPA guidance. Extension cords or other temporary wiring devices are not permitted to be used to connect electrical devices in the facility to a portable and mobile generator. These temporary wiring devices are prohibited due to the potential for shock, fire, and tripping hazards when using such devices. The type of protection needed for the fuel stored by the facility for use by the portable and mobile generator will depend on the amount of fuel stored and the location of the storage, as per the appropriate NFPA standard. If a facility, has a permanent generator to maintain emergency power, LSC and NFPA 110 provisions such as generator location, testing, fuel storage and maintenance, etc. will apply and the facility may be subject to LSC surveys to ensure compliance is met. Please also refer to Tag E0041 Emergency and Standby Power Systems for additional requirements for LTC, CAHs and Hospitals. As an example, some ESRD facilities have contracted services with companies who maintain portable emergency generators for the facilities off-site. In the event of an emergency where the facility is unable to reschedule patients or evacuate, the generators are brought to the location in advance to assist in the event of loss of power. Facilities who are not specifically required by the EP Final Rule to have a generator, but are required to meet provision for an alternate source of energy, may consider this approach for their facility. As part of the cooperation and collaboration with emergency preparedness officials required by subsection (a), facilities should also confer with health department and emergency management officials, as well as healthcare coalitions, where available, to determine the types and duration of energy sources that could be available to assist them in providing care to their patient population during an emergency. As part of the risk assessment planning, facilities should determine the feasibility of relying on these sources and plan accordingly. Facilities are not required to provide onsite treatment of sewage or waste, but must make provisions for maintaining necessary services. In addition, we are not specifying necessary services for sewage or waste management; however, facilities are required to follow their current facility-type requirements (e.g., CoPs/CfCs) which may address these areas. For example, LTC facilities are already required to meet Food Receiving and Storage provisions at &sect;483.35(i) Sanitary Conditions, which contain requirements for keeping food off the floor and clear of ceiling sprinklers, sewer/waste disposal pipes, and vents can also help maintain food quality and prevent contamination. Additionally, ESRD facilities under current CfCs at &sect;494.40(a)(4) are also required to have policies and procedures for handling, storage and disposal of potentially infectious waste. Additionally, we would expect facilities under this requirement to ensure current practices are followed, such as those outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and under State-specific laws. Maintaining necessary services may include, but are not limited to, access to medical gases; treatment of soiled linens; disposal of bio-hazard materials for different infectious diseases; and may require additional assistance from transportation companies for safe and appropriate disposal in accordance with nationally accepted industry guidelines for emergency preparedness. Survey Procedures o Verify the emergency plan includes policies and procedures for the provision of subsistence needs including, but not limited to, food, water and pharmaceutical supplies for patients and staff by reviewing the plan. o Verify the emergency plan includes policies and procedures to ensure adequate alternate energy sources, including emergency power necessary to maintain: - Temperatures to protect patient health and safety and for the safe and sanitary storage of provisions; - Emergency lighting; and, - Fire detection, extinguishing, and alarm systems. o Verify the emergency plan includes policies and procedures to provide for sewage and waste disposal.</p>

		<p>[(b) Policies and procedures. The hospice must develop and implement emergency preparedness policies and procedures, based on the emergency plan set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, risk assessment at paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the communication plan at paragraph (c) of this section. The policies and procedures must be reviewed and updated at least annually.] At a minimum, the policies and procedures must address the following: (1) Procedures to follow up with on duty staff and patients to determine services that are needed, in the event that there is an interruption in services during or due to an emergency. The hospice must inform State and local officials of any on-duty staff or patients that they are unable to contact.</p>
		<label>Interpretive Guidelines</label>
		<p>Hospices have the flexibility to determine how best to develop these policies and procedures. For administrative purposes, all hospices should already have some mechanism in place to keep track of patients and staff contact information. However, the information regarding patient services that are needed during or after an interruption in their services and on-duty staff and patients that were not able to be contacted must be readily available, accurate, and shareable among officials within and across the emergency response system, as needed, in the interest of the patient. Survey Procedures o Review the emergency plan to verify it includes policies and procedures for following up with staff and patients. o Interview a staff member or leadership and ask them to explain the procedures in place in the event they are unable to contact a staff member or patient.</p>

The HHA must develop and implement emergency preparedness policies and procedures, based on the emergency plan set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, risk assessment at paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the communication plan at paragraph (c) of this section. The policies and procedures must be reviewed and updated at least annually. At a minimum, the policies and procedures must address the following:] (1) The plans for the HHA's patients during a natural or man-made disaster. Individual plans for each patient must be included as part of the comprehensive patient assessment, which must be conducted according to the provisions at §484.55.</p>
		<label>Interpretive Guidelines</label>
		<p>HHAs must include policies and procedures in its emergency plan for ensuring all patients have an individualized plan in the event of an emergency. That plan must be included as part of the patient's comprehensive assessment. For example, discussions to develop individualized emergency preparedness plans could include potential disasters that the patient may face within the home such as fire hazards, flooding, and tornados; and how and when a patient is to contact local emergency officials. Discussions may also include patient, care providers, patient representative, or any person involved in the clinical care aspects to educate them on steps that can be taken to improve the patient's safety. The individualized emergency plan should be in writing and could be as simple as a detailed emergency card to be kept with the patient. HHA personnel should document that these discussions occurred and also keep a copy of the individualized emergency plan in the patient's file as well as provide a copy to the patient and or their caregiver. Survey Procedures o Through record review, verify that each patient has an individualized emergency plan documented as part of the patient's comprehensive assessment.</p>

		<p>Discharge summaries typically contain the following items: * Admission and discharge dates; * Physician responsible for the home health plan of care; * Reason for admission to home health; * Type of services provided and frequency of services; * Laboratory data; * Medications the patient is on at the time of discharge; * Patient's discharge condition; * Patient outcomes in meeting the goals in the plan of care; and * Patient and family post-discharge instructions. A discharge summary must be sent to the primary care practitioner or other health care professional who will be responsible for providing care and services to the patient after discharge from the HHA (if any) within five (5) business days of the date of the order for discharge from the responsible physician. The contents of a transfer summary typically contains the same components as a discharge summary.</p>
